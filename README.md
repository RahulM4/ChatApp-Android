The goal of this project is to develop a WhatsApp clone using Java programming language with Firebase Realtime Database as the backend, along with phone OTP verification for user authentication. The project aims to replicate the core functionalities of the popular messaging app WhatsApp, allowing users to send text messages, make voice and video calls, and share multimedia files.

# Key Features: #

- [x] User Registration and Authentication: Users will be able to register with their phone numbers and authenticate themselves using phone OTP verification. Firebase Authentication will be used to handle user authentication securely.

- [x] Contact List Management: The application will provide a feature to manage contacts, allowing users to add, delete, and search for contacts. The contact list will be stored and synchronized in the Firebase Realtime Database.

- [x] Real-time Messaging: Users will be able to send and receive text messages in real-time. The messages will be securely transmitted and stored in the Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring reliable and instant communication between users.

- [x] Multimedia Sharing: The application will support the sharing of multimedia files such as images, videos, and documents. Users will be able to select and send these files to their contacts seamlessly.

- [x] Voice and Video Calling: The WhatsApp clone will incorporate voice and video calling functionalities. Users will be able to initiate calls with their contacts, enabling real-time audio and video communication using Firebase's Realtime Database and WebRTC technology.

- [x] Group Chats: Users will have the ability to create and participate in group chats. Group messages will be stored and synchronized in the Firebase Realtime Database, allowing participants to exchange messages and media files within the group.

- [x] Push Notifications: The application will send push notifications to users for incoming messages, calls, and other relevant events. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) will be utilized to implement this feature, ensuring users stay updated even when the application is in the background.

- [x] Offline Mode: The application will support offline mode, allowing users to access their previous conversations, view shared media, and compose messages even when there is no internet connection. The local storage on the device will be utilized to store and retrieve offline data.
# Tech Stack: #

- Programming Language: Java
- Backend: Firebase Realtime Database
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- Communication: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- WebRTC: For voice and video calling - [x] Not Implemented
- Development Environment: Android Studio (for Android application development)
# Security: #

 User Authentication: The application will utilize Firebase Authentication, which provides a secure and reliable authentication mechanism. Phone OTP verification will be used to validate user phone numbers during registration.

- End-to-End Encryption: To ensure the privacy and security of user communications, end-to-end encryption will be implemented. This means that messages and media files exchanged between users will be encrypted on the sender's device and decrypted only on the recipient's device.

- Data Storage: User data, including messages and media files, will be stored in the Firebase Realtime Database. Firebase ensures the security of data through authentication and access control rules, providing a safe and reliable storage solution.

- Secure Communication: Voice and video calls will be established using WebRTC, which incorporates encryption protocols for secure communication between users.
